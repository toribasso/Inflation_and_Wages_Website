Now that you have established that Inflation increasing at a higher rate than wages. Lets see how bad of an issue this seems to be.

## Importing Data

```{r Import, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
DatasetForRProject <- read_excel("DatasetForRProject.xlsx")
```

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r DescriptiveStat, message=FALSE}
summary(DatasetForRProject)
```

The General Average Wage has much higher measures of spread than median measures of spread.
This may indicate that there are large outliers influencing the average wage to be higher.
If we look at wages-by-degree, it seems like having a degree is much more helpful for wages than
not having a degree.

```{r LineGraphs, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=DatasetForRProject, aes(x=Year, y=GeneralMedianWage, group=1)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()
ggplot(data=DatasetForRProject, aes(x=Year, y=GeneralAverageWage, group=1)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()
```

This seems like average has less point-to-point variation than the median wage category. 

```{r InitialCorr}
library(Hmisc)
flattenCorrMatrix <- function(cormat, pmat) {
  ut <- upper.tri(cormat)
  data.frame(
    row = rownames(cormat)[row(cormat)[ut]],
    column = rownames(cormat)[col(cormat)[ut]],
    cor  =(cormat)[ut],
    p = pmat[ut]
    )
}
res2<-rcorr(as.matrix(DatasetForRProject[,1:9]))
flattenCorrMatrix(res2$r, res2$P)
```
