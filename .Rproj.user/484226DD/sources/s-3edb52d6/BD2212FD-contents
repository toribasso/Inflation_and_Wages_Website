I am currently working on my Master's of Science Degree in Biostatistics (Graduate in May of 2022) and I come with a previous background in biology, mathematics, environmental studies, and secondary education. I have a passion for the sciences and statistics. I also love learning and growing in experience and knowledge. You can find me in my free time hitting golf balls on the golf course or hiking through a nearby park.
