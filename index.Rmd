title: "Project on Wages and Inflation"

Hello! Welcome to my project. This project was initiated by
my passion for Personal Finance and my R Programming course
STA 518.

As of February 2022, the unadjusted Consumer Price Index for the past 12 months was
7.9% ([source](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)). This seems to be 
insanely high and I wondered if wages has kept up with this inflation rate.
